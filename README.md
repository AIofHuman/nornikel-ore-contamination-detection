This is example of custom train YOLO v5 for solve compitation task https://www.kaggle.com/c/nornikel-ore-contamination-detection/submissions.

# Project steps:
1. EDA of data.
2. Transform images
3.

  The model is not perfect, but quite accurately detects the position of the comet in the picture. The model can be improved by increasing the training dataset or by training it on images from one camera. If you have 100-150 comet images, then you can create your own comet detection model, for your camera.

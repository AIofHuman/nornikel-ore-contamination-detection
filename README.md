# nornikel-ore-contamination-detection
This is solution of competition task https://www.kaggle.com/c/nornikel-ore-contamination-detection/submissions. Transfer learing of the YOLO v5 model shows good results and can be used in problems of this kind. This repo might be helpful as an example that implements [train YOLOv5 custom data.](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/wiki/Train-Custom-Data)


# Project steps:
1. EDA of data.
2. Transform images and labels to YOLO v5 format
3. Train model
4. Predict
5. Make submission file

The model is not perfect, but quite accurately detects objects on the transporter.

# Instead of end:
Here is an idea, let artificial intelligence replace humans when sorting garbage, the solution is simple: we will sort plastic bottles by blowing them into a container with an air jet, the signal of which will be given by YOLO. Let's make the world a better and cleaner ðŸ˜Š!
